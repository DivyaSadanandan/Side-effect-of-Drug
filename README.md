# Side-effect-of-Drug

The objective of this project is to build a classification model that classifies the side effect of a particular drug by age, gender and race.
The dataset in the center of this project provides user reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions they are used for, and ratings reflecting overall patient satisfaction. It also has columns for the medication's side effects that can possibly occur, data about the patient's age, date it was reviewed and also two other types of rating: effectiveness and ease of use.
